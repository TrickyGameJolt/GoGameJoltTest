# GoGameJoltTest
Just a small program meant to test the Go Game Jolt library for Go

I've disabled the issue tracker. This is only a test program. Most bugs caused here should be put in the issue tracker of the library itself anyway, and the rare bugs you could find in this test program could be put there as well.
